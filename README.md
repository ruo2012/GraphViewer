# GraphViewer
Graph Viewer made in C#

Done:
-----
* Basic Graph Drawing on a Canvas
* File Loading (Doesn't do anything yet because of Default Codec)
* Codec/Plugin System

To Do:
------
* Graph Navigation
* Graph Esthetics
* Finish Default Codec to read files
* More Codec Management Options (ex: uninstall)

Possible Code Improvements:
---------------------------
* Remove Magic-numbers (there are still a few)
* Plugins are fully code-driven. It could be nice to use json/XML files for meta data
